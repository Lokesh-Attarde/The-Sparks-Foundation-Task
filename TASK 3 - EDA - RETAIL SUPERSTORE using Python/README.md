# üèΩ‚Äç Conclusions
## Weak Areas where we can Work to make More Profit -
* Profits and Sales are not Linear in most of the states.
* Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Arizona, Tennesse, Orgeon, Colorado and Ohio are the loss making states.
* Central region needs to be given more attention.
* Machines and supplies are having less profit and are a loss making sub-category.
* Furnitures are not providing much profit margin with increase in discount.
* Higher discounts are not of much use, the profit are in negative and even the sales are having downtrend after 60% discount.
* The Office Supplies has maximum loss at 80% discount.
* In segements, Standard Class has less profit with low number of sales.
* Even thought Technology gives maximum profit but if the discounts are 70% this will lead to huge loss.
* In central region, Office supplies and Furniture categories facing huge loss with increase in Discounts, similarly in consumer segments also.

## What all Business Problems you can derive by Exploring the Data -
### How to Maximise the Profits along with Sales Improvement?
* Technology gives more profit with maximum sales compared to furniture category.
* Profits can be maximised if the Ship mode is 'Same day'.
* Western region has more profit margins with increase in sales, by analysing the marketing stratergies the profit of other regions can be increased.
* Discount less than or equal to 50% is having highest sales and profit marging.
* Provide optimal Discount to Technology and Furniture to attract much customers
* In Segments, Home-office has High Profit & sales, suggest to promote more for higher profits.
* In East region, Technology category has maximum sales with huge profit and discount around 13%.
* Florida makes maximum sales in Home-Office segment espically in Technology category followed by Indiana in Corperate segment.
