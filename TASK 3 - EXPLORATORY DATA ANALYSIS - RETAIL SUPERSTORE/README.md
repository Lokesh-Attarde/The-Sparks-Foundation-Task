* California seems to make more Profit in Total i.e. 76 Thousand Dollar and New York is also doing pretty well in Total Profit i.e. 74 Thousand Dollars compared to any other States in United States.
* However, if we take Avg. Profitability of Cities in each States into consideration, then some other States perform even better than California. We can see that, in terms of Avg. Profitability, New York State is having higher Profitability Ratio i.e. 29.84% whereas California is having 27.83%.
* New York City is the most Profitable City which has the Total Profit of 66 Thousand Dollars and the Avg. Profitability is around 31.98% and Then, the Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco,and many more.
* "Standard Class" is having Highest Sales & Profit, wherein the "Same Day" is having the Lowest Sales & Profit.
* "Consumer" is having the Highest Sales and Highest Profit in terms of West Region. Whereas, the "Home Office" is the Lowest profitable in terms of South Region.
* From Region & Segment wise Profit Loss, it is very prominent that the "East" and "West" are doing pretty well whereas "Central" & "South" are not doing very good. 
* From Ship Mode vs Profit Analysis Plot, it very prominent that "Standard Class" is having Highest Profit i.e. 57.29%, wherein the "Same Day" is having the Lowest Profit i.e. 5.55%.
* "Office supplies" are doing pretty Well. So, we can say that giving a good Discount is helping them to achieve a Good Profit.
